> **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It’s inevitable that where there is a perceived value in something, there are people who seek to illegally obtain it. Ransomware, blackmail, and fraudulent exchange are just some of the ways that criminals seek to take advantage of the open nature of crypto-currency. That’s why when Michael founded the business in 2014, it initially targeted law enforcement services as its primary market before expanding into crypto-currency exchanges." [^2]

<br>

> **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Backed by Venture Capitalist, Benchmark and Accel amongst the 26 investors. 12 of which are lead investors through 9 rounds of capital raising. Funding received thus far is $366.6M USD with the recent round of funding coming in at $100M, making the company's valuation at $4.2billion according to Crunchbase [^3]

<br>

> **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, Cryptocurrency businesses don't have bank accounts to transact with. The idea came about how do we help these companies obtain a bank account. So there must be a better way and manage the risk by leveraging the transparency blockchain inheritly offers, while filling in the gap by helping banks offer accounts to Cryptocurrency companies, making sure that the government were comfortable in regulating/overseeing/ensuring the Cryptocurrency market. Today, Chainalysis helps governments and private sector companies detect and prevent the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in illicit activities like money laundering with its investigations and compliance software. - *Jonathan Levin*

<br>

> **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

    - Cryptocurrencies Businesses - Binance 
    - Financial Institutions - Paypal, Square, Robin Hood, Barclay
    - Government Agencies - UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), US Law enforcement agencies

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially in the company's journey, its intended customers were Cryptocurrencies business whom do not have a means to transfer value to physical tender eg. lack of bank account due to trust and risk. As the tool became so useful that it was able to show the entire value transaction flow in blockchain transactions that government agencies were willing to pursue Chainalysis to help manage the risk of the Cryptocurrency market. As the Cryptocurrency Businesses trending upwards of a $ 2 Trillion USD market [^1], the need for transparency and monitor transactions become more and more critical from a regulatory point of view and a means to transfer value. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regtech industry is tipped to grow from 5.31Billion USD in 2019 to 33.6Billion USD in 2026 that's a CAGR of 21.27% according to Globenewsire [^4]. Serving the Cryptocurrency market worth over $2 Trillion USD is enough to ensure that Chainalysis stay in business and opportunities aplenty for a long time.

<br>

> **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REACTOR, one of Chainalysis general purpose investigation/visualisation software for cryptocurrency analysis, the tool shows with in-depth detail where the value transfer of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. They did not restrict them to any particular cryptocurrency which gives the tool a broad appeal and opened further opportunities into complimentary industries. The real competitive advantage other competitors do not offer is in two folds. One, Chainalysis has been capturing and creating a database of all the endpoints in the Cryptocurrency world since 2014  - this may include the IP addresses, poly network address, device fingerprints, using various algorithms to help validate their data. It is this validity of this data that makes them competitive, it is also claimed by Chainalysis that their validity of data is held up in the court of law. Second, their association and clientele with US law enforcement agencies that helps them with the credibiility of being a trusted source of transaction monitor - if it's good enough for the government, it's good enough for me mentality.

Here is an example of the visualisation of transfer of value through the cryptocurrency world:

> **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of Chainalysis product lin such as KYT (Know Your Transaction) uses REST based API to provides its services to clients, mostly enterprises and allows their clients to use its internal systems to communicate with the KYT. All KYT API access is secured using HTTPS with TLS (v1.2) being supported. Chainalysis provides service-level identification, not individual-level identification meaning it already has a built up database of services and their unique identifiers.

## **Results:**

<br>

>  **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

    Chainalysis's estimated annual revenue is currently $29.9M per year

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although not reflective of the financials, Chainalysis has brought a level of transparency that Cryptocurrencies are promised to bring, this comes in the form of being able to trace transfer of value across different cryptocurrencies and doing so with high degrees of confidence. Their service will no doubt eventuate to broader confidence of the uptake of cryptocurrencies.

<br>

> **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chainalysis was founded to solve critical problems inhibiting the growth of the cryptocurrency industry. Our regulatory platform protects the ecosystem from abuse and increasingly our data drives investment decisions. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chainalysis measure their success against the pace of the industry’s growth. Chainalysis's ambition is to beat the market. To stay ahead of bad actors. To make bets on the most promising innovations in the ecosystem. To further enable global adoption.

<br>

> **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this domain is still relatively new and consistently redefining itself, it seems that there is very little like for like comparisons within its own domain. However, given it's 'Startup' status, and the successful 9 round of fundings it has achieved, high profile venture capitalist seems to be bullish that the company is performing on par if not above expectations.

## **Recommendations:**
***
<br>

> **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chainalysis is already going down this path, which is to look at collaborating with an existing financial institute where it is able to open the opportunity where established institution may want to jump into Cryptocurrency market unknowingly. Their partnership with Barclay Accelerator program is a huge step in that direction. From that point of view, I believe their IP is in the identification of illicit activities in the digital world of the cryptocurrency, it is therefore possible to create a cryptocurrency without all the loop holes and provide a 'safer' mechanism of value transfer which could replace the existing SWIFT system.

<br>


> **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  SWIFT payment is the current way of sending money international, its pitfalls is exactly how blockchain technology can help eliminate. Given the company vision to further enable further adoption of blockchain, it would be logical to partner up with the existing financial institutions to further that vision.

<br>

> **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Start with building its own blockchain or endorse an existing cryptocurrency whilst wrapping its services around that to minimise risk and maximise transparency.
APIs, open source software and a sustainable source of electricity to keep the 'blocks' running.

<br>

> **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The fundamental building blocks of a blockchain are to spread the secure blocks across the globe and APIs to help read/write to each block.
